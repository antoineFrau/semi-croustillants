## Content

### CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is needed when your application doesn't have the same url (or port) than your API.

So we add it here because the future app will run standalone.

### Authentification 

JWT Auth is already implemented. It's needed to make a request to our api. You get it when you login with email/password, or register.

Then to access user informations (do other request to our API) you need to pass the token in the header of your HTTP request like that:
```
Authorization Bearer eyJ0..
```

## Code of Conduct

### Controller

A controller doesn't have any custom methods. Only `index`, `update`, `store`, `create`, `edit`, `destroy`.

Create a new controller for custom methods, like Authentification, ect..

### Model
All requests to the database (using Eloquent ORM) need to be declared here.
